Impact is measured by the stability and readiness of students over time. Since starting with 31 students in 2004, the foundation has built steady programming that keeps learners present and prepared.

## Markers of progress
- Students are nourished, healthy, and supported to stay in class throughout the year
- Alumni remain connected through university, ensuring the model follows them into adulthood
- Families trust the school environment because barriers are addressed without stigma

## Trust for partners
- Transparent financial reporting and compliance as an Ethiopian Foreign Charity and US 501(c)(3)
- President self-funds administrative travel to keep program resources focused on students
- Partnerships with banks, embassies, and international NGOs provide external accountability
