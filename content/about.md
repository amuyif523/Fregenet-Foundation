The foundation was created in 2004 by Tafesse Woubshet and Melesech Gebbre to honor the life and promise of Fregenet Leeza Tafesse Woubshet. It began with 31 students and a commitment to remove every obstacle that kept children from learning.

Over more than two decades, the team has paired academic instruction with nutrition, healthcare access, and family advocacy. The work is intentionally calm, consistent, and transparent so donors, partners, and families know that the foundation will remain a steady presence for students.

The foundation operates as an Ethiopian Foreign Charity with recognition as a US 501(c)(3), positioning it to welcome both local and international partners who share its focus on grounded, ethical education.
