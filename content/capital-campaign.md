The foundation has secured 1,670 m2 of land from the Addis Ababa City Administration to establish a permanent campus. Designs donated by Blu Dot Architects & Engineers outline a multi-story facility that will hold classrooms, nutrition services, and community spaces under one roof.

## Why it matters
- Eliminates reliance on rented facilities and protects continuity for students
- Places nutrition, healthcare access, and instruction in a single permanent environment
- Demonstrates long-term stewardship to public agencies, donors, and families

## What is needed
- Capital commitments to move from design to construction
- Partners who value transparent reporting and steady delivery of services
- Multi-year collaboration to complete the build without interrupting current programming
