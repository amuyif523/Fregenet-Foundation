Governance is structured to earn trust from public agencies, families, and donors. The foundation operates as an Ethiopian Foreign Charity and is recognized as a US 501(c)(3), ensuring compliance across jurisdictions.

## Leadership practices
- President self-funds administrative travel so program funds stay directed to students
- Board and leadership maintain policies that prioritize predictable delivery of nutrition, healthcare access, and instruction
- Financial reporting is shared transparently with institutional partners
- Governance practices are reviewed with partners to maintain accountability across Addis Ababa and Bishoftu

## External confidence
- Registrations and compliance records are kept current for embassy, foundation, and bank reviews
- Collaborations with banks, embassies, and international NGOs provide ongoing accountability
- Capital planning and program budgets are aligned to the whole-child model and 1:30 classroom ratios
